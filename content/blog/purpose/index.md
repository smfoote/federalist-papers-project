The [US Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) is a divine document,
[inspired by God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.80?lang=eng#p80).
Our national identity, as Americans, is defined in this document, its amendments, and its interpretations.
It constitutes who we are, who we should be, who we strive to be. It is a model that has been used by many
nations around the world as they have established their own constitutions. The Constitution is worthy of
our time and attention.

One of the most powerful interpretations of the US Constitution comes to us in the form of the Federalist Papers.
Written by three founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, the Federalist Papers gives
us an interpretation of the Constitution from a primary source. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison were present
at the Constitutional Convention, and James Madison's Virginia Plan was the blueprint for what eventually became
the signed and ratified Constitution. John Jay was the first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
These authors knew the Constitution, and the intentions of its framers, better than anyone.

A modern reading of the Federalist Papers may remind us, as Americans, who we are, who we should be, who we
strive to be. As a nation, we have never been homogeneous. We have always had varied interests, desires,
and opinions. But, our unity has always been strengthened by our differences. E pluriubs unumâ€“out of many, one.

The purpose of this project is to help make the Federalist Papers accessible to our modern understanding. The
language of the Federalist Papers can be difficult for a public so steeped in text messages and tweets to readily
understand. In this project, I hope to give a modern interpretation to each (or many) of the Federalist Papers.
I claim no special privilege or ability in interpreting the words of the past, and I am certain that I will get
things wrong, and I welcome correction. My hope in all this is to increase our unity and national pride.

I cannot hope to improve upon the quality of the original authors work. I'm certain, actually, that some of the
original meaning will be lost. This is not intentional, but nearly inevitable, given the nature of the project.
Still, I think that project may be worthwhile if through it more people take an interest in understanding the US
Constitution and the principles upon which it is founded.

The essays will be written in the original voice, as if I were the original author, Publius. The events and
circumstances that were current then will be treated as if they were current now, with a few exceptions.

I hope you enjoy!

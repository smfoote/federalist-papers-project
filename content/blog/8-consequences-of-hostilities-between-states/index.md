Yeah, I dropped the mic last time<br/>
And yeah, I picked it up 'cause I'm<br/>
Still in my prime plus I<br/>
Thought of another rhyme.<br/>

So, you think that we'll never fight, that<br/>
Through the war we are united.<br/>
Ignorance is almost a crime, and<br/>
You want to know how and why, then<br/>
I'll let these lines leave you enlightened.<br/>

Three words:<br/>
Land<br/>
Business<br/>
Debt<br/>

Well, we've been blessed<br/>
with wild wealth in the West.<br/>
States're all scheming,<br/>
Playin' it close to the vest.<br/>
But in case you havenâ€™t guessed,<br/>
Yes, we're in for a mess.<br/>

Now, let's<br/>
Be real about this.<br/>
Is it too late to say<br/>
How I feel about this?<br/>
No one can give<br/>
Even a slap on the wrist<br/>
When separate states<br/>
Can just do as they wish. <br/>

We fought together for this land.<br/>
We'll fight each other for that land.<br/>
Without Washington's steady hand<br/>
Who can give us a command?<br/>

Now states are scrapping for Wyoming.<br/>
Man, Wyoming?! See where this is going?<br/>
Like the shores that keep eroding,<br/>
Rivers and rhymes that keep on flowing,<br/>
Like the debts we keep on owing.<br/>
Half the battle is just knowing.<br/>

And you know we've<br/>
Already caught beef<br/>
With half the country<br/>
Over our port fees<br/>
And real estate schemes.<br/>
Now do you feel me?<br/>

If we stay together<br/>
And pay together<br/>
We'll lean on each other<br/>
And that's great.<br/>
But if we split up,<br/>
Well, then we'll get a<br/>
Lien on our entire state.<br/>
Are we still having this debate?<br/>
No.<br/>

So, it's the UNION I propose,<br/>
And the general welfare it promotes,<br/>
Or we'll be at each other's throats,<br/>
And we'll tax each other's goats.<br/>
Let's build bridges instead of moats.<br/>
We could be friends instead of foes.<br/>
We could avoid these awful woes.<br/>
We can choose how our story goes.<br/>

Let's go.

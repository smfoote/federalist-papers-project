Now that I have proven my position<br/>
And I assume that we can take it as a given,<br/>
Yet I've still got ammunition, if you'll listen,<br/>
So I'll elucidate the situation we would live in.<br/>

Go ahead, sit back and you'll<br/>
See my logic is sound and my words are factual.<br/>
Unlike Europe, we don't have castles<br/>
That'll make the prospect of perpetual<br/>
Battles as a matter of fact, mathematically impractical.<br/>

Actually<br/>
We'd make a<br/>
Casualty<br/>
Of our<br/>
Free society<br/>
By army and<br/>
Admiralty<br/>

The states will start gathering their forces.<br/>
They say most unions end in divorces.<br/>
Ours would end with guns and charging horses.<br/>
It's not too late to change courses.<br/>

Of course it's<br/>
Never a sure bet.<br/>
But when troops take your bed<br/>
I bet you'd forfeit<br/>
(Not to be morbid)<br/>
Your freedoms for your head.<br/>
Would it be worth it?<br/>

We're not alone on an English island.<br/>
We're not protected by Scottish highlands.<br/>
Without forts, things'll get violent<br/>
Like the trenches we left our blood, sweat, and bile in.<br/>

Well, is that what we want?<br/>
All of our borders become battle fronts.<br/>
Suppose Pennsyl-van-i-a pulls a stunt<br/>
And then New Jersey pulls out their guns.<br/>
Yeah, well I warned you; don't look so stunned, son.<br/>

There's an ocean between us and Europe;<br/>
Canadians are too cold and polite to stir up<br/>
Any problems. So the problem's if we're up<br/>
To the task of Union this Constitution will shore up.<br/>
(Sure 'nuff)<br/>

This is our chance<br/>
To let progress<br/>
Instead of armies advance.<br/>
We're protected by<br/>
The Atlantic's expanse.<br/>
We could flourish,<br/>
Fulfill our wishes and plans<br/>
Or be stuck fighting<br/>
Instead of sowing some plants.<br/>
Let farmers push plows<br/>
Instead of wielding a lance.<br/>
Union is how<br/>
We can protect our lands.<br/>

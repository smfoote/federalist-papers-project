The question of adopting the Constitution is a really big deal. Probably the most important that
will ever come before anyone alive today. We should all take the time to understand what is
being decided. Don't just read the headlines. Really understand for yourself.

Government is necessary, there's no denying that. And for a government to actually be effective
in any way, the people being governed have to give up some of their natural rights. If they
don't, the government won't really be able to do anything. So, given this, we have to decide
whether it's better to give up some of our rights to a single federal government or to a
number of separate smaller nations or confederacies.

For a long time, this issue has been a non-issue. Everyone agreed that our best bet for
prosperity and happiness was to remain firmly united. But we can no longer take that
for granted; there are politicians now who, get this, are claiming that our safety and
happiness would be better provided if we broke up into separate countries. As bizarre and
illogical as that sounds, there are a growing number of people who believe it. Even people
who were, until recently, strongly in favor of the UNION. Regardless of why these people have
taken up this position, it would not be wise for the nation as a whole to follow along
without being convinced that the position is founded on truth and sound policy.

America is not made up of far-distant islands and territories. It is a continuous fertile land,
connected by navigable waters in the ocean and some of the greatest rivers in the world that act
as highways to ease transport and communication.

It is wonderful that God has blessed this connected land with a united people, speaking the same
language, having common ancestry, religious beliefs, political persuasions, manners, and customs.<sup>1</sup>
This unity has allowed us to band together to fight in a long and bloody war to establish our freedom and
independence.

This land and this people are a perfect match, and it seems that God wants us to remain united rather
than to break up into a bunch of jealous, warring neighbor-countries.

To this point we have always acted as a single nation. We have all enjoyed the same rights of citizenship,
regardless of where we live. We have made peace and war as a single nation. We have beaten our common
enemies and established our independence as a single nation. We have made treaties, alliances, and
conventions with foreign states as a single nation.

Knowing as we did the advantages of our Union, we established a united federal government as soon as we were
independent. Really, we established it before we had earned our independence by our blood. Our homes were
still in flames. Our sons, brothers, and fathers were still shivering in the fields. Our enemies were at our
doors when we first established a federal government. It's no surprise that, now that we're actually using it,
the government that was thrown together in those circumstances is, to put it lightly, insufficient.

We're a very smart people, though, and we saw the weakness of the Articles of Confederation. But we're not going
to throw the baby (union and liberty) out with the bathwater. So, we sent some of the smartest among us, many
of whom have proven their patriotism on the field of war, to a convention in Philadelphia, to consider
what can be done to preserve our union and liberty.

The circumstances of this convention were completely different than the one that gave us the Articles of
Confederation. They met in a time of peace, without the sound of cannons threatening to end the meeting
early. They spent months in cool deliberation, despite the heat of the Philadelphia summer. They sought
no power, and were influenced by nothing more than their love of country. In the end, they brought forth
a plan that they unanimously support.

Footnote 1: The lack of diversity in these lines grates on the modern ears. We recognize the great benefit
of diversity in our time. But, we shouldn't be too quick to judge our Founding Fathers. The homogeneity
(or perceived homogeneity; we won't at this time get into the issue that Jay is entirely ignoring the
presence of an entire race of people who were absolutely essential to the building up of this nation,
despite their being enslaved at the time) may have been exactly what was necessary at that time to
establish the liberties that allow for a diverse country in our time.

First, I'd like to thank you for your patience.<br>
Now, let's take our lesson from the ancients.<br>
How, if you put it to the Roman sages,<br>
They would say the question is outrageous.<br>

Sparta, Carthage, Athens and Rome:<br>
All republics,<br>
Always at war,<br>
All overthrown.<br>
And now Shays' Rebellion<br>
That hits close to home.<br>
Peace can't be ensured<br>
By commerce alone.<br>

But, let's say that we follow this line of thought,<br>
Throw away Union and all that our blood has bought.<br>
I'm not a better but I'd bet we're not better off<br>
Fighting among us like young Turks and Romanovs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup><br>

If you don't think that's our fate you're<br>
Just ignoring human nature.<br>
And yes, I will elaborate, sure.<br>
Let's say Virginia's magistrate or<br>
Czar, president or king<br>
Has a fling<br>
With the queen<br>
Of New Orleans.<br>
Imagine the blood that will bring,<br>
And we the people get caught in between.<br>
It's obscene,<br>

But we've seen this scene,<br>
On repeat it seems,<br>
Play out with queens<br>
Like it plays out in Queens.<br>
It happened three times<br>
Just with Pericles.<br>

So please<br>
Don't tell me<br>
That unionless states will always have peace.<br>
That commerce will save us from history's<br>
Surest fate. That we'll proceed with ease.<br>
That a dog won't have fleas<br>
'Cause it doesn't want fleas.<br>
Republics start wars just as often as kings.<br>
Power starts fights just as often as greed.<br>
It's all in the books, how can you not see<br>
If we don't have union we'll never have peace?!<br>

<div id="footnote-1"><a name="footnote-1">Footnote 1:</a> This is a bit
 of a stretch, but I liked the rhyme (and quasi-internal rhyme) enough
 to leave it. Russia officially declared war on Turkey (AKA the Ottoman
 Empire) in 1787 while Catherine the Great ruled Russia, around the time
 the original Federalist Papers were being published. It all seems to
 line up so nicely, and Hamilton was very current on world events
 (that's clear from a reading of the original text of Federalist No. 6)
 and he would have known about the war. The problem is that Catherine
 the Great was not a Romanov. Her late husband and predecessor, Peter
 III, was a Romanov, though, so I'm going to say that's close enough.

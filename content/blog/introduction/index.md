As anyone even half awake can clearly see, the government under the Articles of Confederation is
comically ineffective. But, now we have the opportunity to start again with a new Constitution of
the United States, if we choose it. This isn't just another ballot measure. We're talking about the
very fate of the country. No, not just the country. We're deciding the fate of all mankind. The
United States, the most interesting country in the world if I do say so myself, is the country to
which all others look for an example. They look to us and our example, especially on the question
of whether a government can be established by deliberate thought and choice, or if all governments
must always be the result of accident and force. We cannot fail in our consideration of the constitution.
The world is watching.

If this is all true, then we are being philanthropists and not just patriots, and all good and wise
people will take extra care to make the right choice. Hopefully our choice will be based on what is
actually best for us, without any bias for special interests. But I dream. The Constitution affects
so many special interests and changes so much of how we are governed even locally, that we won't be
able to discuss the choice of adopting the Constitution based only on the merits of the Constitution;
the biases of the special interests will certainly make their way into the conversation.

There are people today who will lose power, position, pay, and influence if the new Constitution is
adopted. There are others who hope to profit from the confusion and chaos that will ensue if the
Constitution is not adopted. Don't think that they will not put up a fight.

But let's not think too much about that. It's not fair for us to say that, just because a person
has a lot to lose by the adoption of the Constitution, that they will necessarily oppose it. And
those who do oppose the Constitution may do so with the best of intentions. There are so many
powerful and persuasive forces that bias our judgment. <b>There are good people on both sides of every
argument, so don't be so quick to judge those on the other side, and don't be too sure that you
are always right.</b> And just because someone happens to be on the right side of an issue does not
mean that they are there for good reasons. Jealousy and greed work just as well on the right as the
wrong side of an issue. Be tolerant of other people, because you won't convince anyone to come to your
side by persecution or intimidation.

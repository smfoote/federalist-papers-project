This is the last one, then I'm moving on to a new subject. I swear!

In 1706, Queen Anne wrote a letter as England and Scotland were first uniting. We can learn a lot
from it, but 1706 was a long time ago, so I will paraphrase so the lessons can be more easily
understood. She first writes that "the Union will be a foundation for peace, securing religion, liberty
and property. You will stop fighting among yourselves and work together instead. It will improve our
collective strength, wealth, and trade. If the whole island acts as one, we will be able to effectively
_resist all our enemies_." That already sounds like a good deal, and then Queen Anne continues: "Keep
calm and be wise in this important decision, so that the Union may be formed. This is the _only_ real
way to ensure our future happiness. Our enemies don't want us united, and they _will try to delay the Union._"

Since we are most familiar with the history of Great Britain, and it has many useful lessons, we will
learn from their experience. Sure beats making all those same mistakes ourselves. Now, it seems so
obvious that all of the people of such a small island should be a single nation. Why would they not be?
But, for centuries they were divided into three (namely England, Scotland, and Wales), and they were
constantly fighting. Now, it would have been in their best interest to be united, especially when it
came to dealings with the rest of Europe, but they did not act in their own best interest. Instead, they
remained as three distinct nations and got in each others' ways instead of helping each other. For
centuries. Why does this quill not have a face palm emoji?

And do we really want to try that, splitting up into three or four distinct confederacies?
Can't we see that the same thing will happen? Each confederacy would become jealous of the others, and
green is not a good color on us (or anyone). The confederacies would have no common purpose and so they
would only do what is best for themselves instead of the common good of the whole. We would fight like
siblings, as bordering nations always do<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.

Even if we were able to set up three or for perfectly equal confederacies, they would stay equal
for long. Even the wisest advocates of confederacies must admit this. And when they cease to be
equal, and they will, what then? Do we shuffle things up again to try to equalize them? What kind
of policies or mechanisms can we possibly put in place that would forever keep them on equal footing.
Whether it be richer resources or better governance or sheer dumb luck, the confederacies would not
remain equal.

When the scales tip in favor of one confederacy over the others, that is the moment that the
envy and fear will begin among the lesser-endowed confederacies. They will not celebrate the success
of their neighbor. More likely, they will start looking for ways to bring them down. And when that
happens, you better believe that neighbor is going to fight back. Distrust breeds distrust.

Anyone who has actually studied (and understood) history can see that neighboring nations do not
feel love and trust for each other. The only thing we would share is jealousy and distrust, and that
would put us in precisely the position our enemies want to see: weakened by each other to the point
where we our only a threat to ourselves.

Can any proponent of alliances really, truly tell me that alliances will be enough to bring together
the resources and necessary to put up a strong defence against any foreign enemy? Look at the
independent states of Britain or Spain, before they were united. Were they ever able to successfully
combine in such an alliance? The proposed confederacies would be distinct nations with separate
governments. They would make their own laws and sign their own treaties. The Southern confederacy might
go to war with the very country that is the Northern confederacy primary trade partner. So, instead of
an alliance between confederacies, you would see the North allying itself with the enemy of the South.

With the great powers of Europe being so far away, the confederacies would be likely to feel
threatened by each other than any foreign nation. So, instead of forming alliances with each other
to protect _against_ European influence, the confederacies would invite foreign alliances to
protect _against each other._ And remember, it's easy to invite a guest over, but it's much harder to
make them leave. Once foreign boats full of foreign troops and foreign guns are in our harbors, we risk
losing our hard-won independence. Can you not remember how many nations the Romans conquered by coming
in as protectors, then refusing to leave.

Think hard, be wise, and then decide. If we divide America into any number of independent nations,
will that keep us more safe from foreign influence an hostilities?
